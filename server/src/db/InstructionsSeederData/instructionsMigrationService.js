		instructionText: `Basics of PWM (Pulse Width Modulation)<br><br>Pulse Width Modulation, or PWM, is a technique for getting analog results with digital means. Digital control is used to create a square wave, a signal switched between on and off. This on-off pattern can simulate voltages in between the full Vcc of the board (e.g., 5 V on UNO, 3.3 V on a MKR board) and off (0 Volts) by changing the portion of the time the signal spends on versus the time that the signal spends off. The duration of "on time" is called the pulse width. To get varying analog values, you change, or modulate, that pulse width. If you repeat this on-off pattern fast enough with an LED for example, the result is as if the signal is a steady voltage between 0 and Vcc controlling the brightness of the LED.  In the graphic below, the green lines represent a regular time period. This duration or period is the inverse of the PWM frequency. In other words, with Arduino's PWM frequency at about 500Hz, the green lines would measure 2 milliseconds each. `,

Given that the circuit's sole load is the water pump, it can be deduced that the collector current is identical to that of the water pump. Based on the water pump specification, we know that IC = 200 mA, or for practical purposes, IC = 0.2 A. This forms the basis for our calculations.<br>It is important to note that if we exceed the parameters for which the transistor was designed, it will eventually burn out. With this in mind, we will proceed to identify the transistor's gain from the datasheet. We observe that when IC = 200 mA, its gain is 100. We have now discovered our second value: 𝛽 = 100.<br><br>Once we've established the gain, our next step is to calculate the base current. It's important to recognize that the collector current is directly proportional to the base current and the gain. This relationship can be expressed mathematically as:<br><br>hFe = 𝛽 (gain) = Ic / Ib<br>Replacing the values, we acquire our third parameter: Ib = 2mA = 0.002A. Now, we can compute Rb value using Ohm's formula:<br>Vb = VS - VBE = Ib * Rb<br>Rb = (VS - VBE) / Ib<br>Where VS is the source voltage, and VBE is the voltage drop across the base-emitter junction of the transistor.

The LEDs constantly show the moisture level (Red - 0-30%, Yellow - 30-60% and green 60%+ switch on at those levels of moisture), and when the moisture level falls below 10%, the buzzer starts beeping. I designed this for a Port Jackson Ficus Bonsai, and have tested this extensively. The percentages I'm using works perfectly for me but might change depending on your plant. If you feel like the red light switches on way too late, when the soil is already too dry, you can change the Red percentage to 0-50% and Yellow to 50-80%, because that seems to also be working well. <br><br>How it works: <br><br>It works, when electrical currents are sent through the legs of the moisture sensor. The sensor then calculates the resistance it's getting. Since water conducts electricity - the wetter the soil is, the less resistance there should be. It's then connected to an Analog Pin and the Arduino can use that for the program. <br><br>The Soil Moisture Sensor needs to know the maximum moisture that the soil can reach, so we can calculate the percentages. This is called calibration. The sensor calibrates right when the circuit is switched on, in the Setup() function.

There are many libraries for that purpose, but this one worked great and it supports a large number of AC manufacturers with the same code instructions. <br><br>So, if you have a Daikin AC like mine you can use my code below without changes. If you have another brand, follow these steps: <br><br>1. Find the name of the .h file related to your AC model. In my case, that's DaikinHeatpumpIR.h . <br><br>2. Replace DaikinHeatpumpIR.h and DaikinHeatpumpIR in my code with the name you found. <br><br>That's it! If you're lucky enough, you won't need to change other things. <br><br>The code I wrote supports heat/cool/dry modes as well as temperature configuration. It doesn't let you configure fan speed or other parameters, but it's very simple to tweak to expose more parameters. In addition, it detects the pressure of the physical button on the board so that you can use it to test easily if the IR signals are read by the AC unit. `,

		instructionText: `Basics of PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) <br><br>Pulse Width Modulation, or PWM, is a technique for getting analog results with digital means. Digital control is used to create a square wave, a signal switched between on and off. This on-off pattern can simulate voltages in between the full Vcc of the board (e.g., 5 V on UNO, 3.3 V on a MKR board) and off (0 Volts) by changing the portion of the time the signal spends on versus the time that the signal spends off. The duration of "on time" is called the pulse width. To get varying analog values, you change, or modulate, that pulse width. If you repeat this on-off pattern fast enough with an LED for example, the result is as if the signal is a steady voltage between 0 and Vcc controlling the brightness of the LED.  In the graphic below, the green lines represent a regular time period. This duration or period is the inverse of the PWM frequency. In other words, with Arduino's PWM frequency at about 500Hz, the green lines would measure 2 milliseconds each. `,

After the last color, the index resets to zero.<br>Debouncing:<br><br>A small delay (delay(300)) is added after each button press to debounce the button, preventing multiple triggers from a single press.<br><br>This modification allows the RGB LED to change colors each time the button is pressed, providing interactive control over the LED.<br><br>Below is the schematic for my version of the project`,

It is measured in per cents. So, if the humidity is 60 per cent(which is the average humidity), then 60 per cent of the air around you is water vapor. If it is 100%, then it means either the sensor is not correct, the sensor is broken/damaged, the Arduino crashed, the Arduino can't receive any signal, there's an error in the code or you're underwater *.
