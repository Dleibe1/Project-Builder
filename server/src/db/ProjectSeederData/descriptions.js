  `History

My previous project was serious and complex: a programmable wireless thermostat. Thanks to you, it has been viewed more than 3000 times on the Project Hub, and I am very grateful to you.

My goal now is to exceed 5000 views. So I had to imagine a project that would be funnier, more original, simpler and easier to replicate than the thermostat. And totally useless.

So I decided to make this pair of eyes that follows the movements of an object that moves in front of it. It follows the lateral movements, and the eyes converge when the object comes closer. 
And if you're reading this, you clicked. This is great for my goal and I thank you for it.
